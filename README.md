## Comments
Got a lot of help on Friday 23rd in my group tutoring session in understanding the layout and overall coding with inquirer and constructors. I'm finding it difficult to understand how to use the FS npm, which is something I plan to address in the next office hours. Also, learning to apply validators is another area I would like to address in my learning. In future, I feel I need to dedicate more time to the homeworks and properly utlilise office hours more for homewrok related questions in order to properly progress my projects and have them fully fuctional.

On a brighter note, I have been git commiting more regulary which I feel has been a good habit that I've achieved.
